This project push logs from container (sysout) to stackdriver in application as GKE container .Its simply logback librarry to write logs on console This project has docker file ,Which create docker file with file format mentioned as per GCP container .Like docker image name should be gcr.io//imagesname:version First run ./gradlew clean eclipse bootRepackage Then run (docker image build -t imageID .) docker deploy imagename Deply it on kubernates cluser using docker name. This project explain how logs from docker to push to stackdriver. Simply is that ,When you deploy docker images to kubernates,all the logs which are getting write to consol(SOUT) will be pushed to stackdriver. You can see these logs in GKE Container-> cluster name -> search for logs specific or search using filter.

I am very happy that,I have tried all the scenarion of writing logs to stackdriver.Most of companies dont use stackdriver because as per google,there be changes logs might not be published when container is killed.So they use dataflow. My next project will be on that.
